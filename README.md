# Anomaly-prediction-in-cryptocurrencies-market-comparison-between-competitors

In this case study, three different systems able to predict anomalous price variations of
cryptocurrencies were compared to the one proposed by G.Nettis in his thesis work.
For this work the most important cryptocurrencies were taken into account in order to
analyze price movements useful to detect anomalies over time.
